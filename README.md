MusicChart is a simple music application built with nativescript and angular 5 using https://deezer.com public api.

## Overview

MusicChart was created as an experiment to learn and explore the awesome nativescript and angular framework.
The app uses the Deezer API to retrieve track data (thanks [Deezer!](https://www.deezer.com)).
